# Can we have multiple chat services and switch between them?
# retry logic - ex. if you don't like the response, we can try a different model
# transparently switch between models as the conversation progresses - and the context window increases

# Add a system prompt to the chatbot

# Add history truncation (ex. drop oldest) / summarization
# Conditionally summarizing the previous context - ex. if the previous context is too long, summarize it
